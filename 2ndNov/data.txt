Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from end of the Linked List.
For example, if input is below list and n = 3, then output is “B”

Method 1 (Use length of linked list)
1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Method 2 (Use two pointers) 
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer.  Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.  First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.  Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.
Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from end of the Linked List.
For example, if input is below list and n = 3, then output is “B”

Method 1 (Use length of linked list)
1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Method 2 (Use two pointers) 
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer.  Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.  First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.  Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.

Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.
Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from end of the Linked List.
For example, if input is below list and n = 3, then output is “B”

Method 1 (Use length of linked list)
1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Method 2 (Use two pointers) 
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer.  Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.  First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.  Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.

Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.
Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from end of the Linked List.
For example, if input is below list and n = 3, then output is “B”

Method 1 (Use length of linked list)
1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Method 2 (Use two pointers) 
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer.  Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.  First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.  Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.

Please write comments if you find the above codes/algorithms incorrect, or find other ways to solve the same problem.Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from end of the Linked List.
For example, if input is below list and n = 3, then output is “B”

Method 1 (Use length of linked list)
1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Method 2 (Use two pointers) 
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer.  Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.  First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.  Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.
